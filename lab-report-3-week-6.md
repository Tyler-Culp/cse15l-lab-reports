The first thing I did to steamline the ssh process is to create a config file. I created and edited this file just through my terminal on my mac.

The screenshot below shows me logging into the server using just `ssh ieng6`.

In this next screenshot you can also see how much easier it is to scp files now that tis config file is set up. Now I only need to do `scp [filename] ieng6` to copy files over to the server. The screenshot below shows me doing this.
