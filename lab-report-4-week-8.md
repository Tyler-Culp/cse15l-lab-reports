Here are the links to the two repositories that were used in this lab report:

1. Our repo: https://github.com/Combobyte/markdown-parser
2. Their repo: https://github.com/nquach1515/markdown-parser-cse15l

The markdown parsers should produce:

* Snippet 1: [`google.com, google.com, ucsd.edu]
* Snippet 2: [b.com, a.com(()), example.com]
* Snippet 3: [https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/cse-15l-spring-2022/schedule]

Here is the code that shows how I added the tests the the MarkdownParseTest.java file:

And here is a picture of the results after I ran the tests:
